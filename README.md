-- LAWYERIST Considerations--
- To create a local environment we suggest the duplicator plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/), this will give you all te latest plugin, an updated db and an updated environment.

- The root repo need to be localized at the wp-content level, there is some rules inside the .gitignore file to ignore any file inside the wp-content/ folder except the custom plugin and theme we are versioning.

- This is a multi-site installation so make sure your wp-config file is updated.
